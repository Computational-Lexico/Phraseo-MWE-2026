 <h3>Arguments</h3>


                  <p>      Phraseology (Cowie 1998; Granger & Meunier 2008; Mitkov 2017; Mel’čuk 2023; Polguère, 2002, 2014; Mejri 2018; Chen 2021), or multiword expressions (MWEs) (Savary 2008; Constant 2012), play a central role in language structure, lexical creativity, and cultural expression (Chen 2022a, 2022b). While MWEs have traditionally been associated with stability and conventionalization, contemporary language use—particularly in digital media, journalism, and social networks—reveals a growing number of innovative phrasemes that challenge existing theoretical and computational models (Chen 2025).</p>
    <p>In recent years, the emergence of phraseological neologisms ((Lombard, Huyghe, Gygax 2021; Serebriak 2024)—newly created or resemanticized idioms, collocations, proverbs and paroemias, locutions, support verb constructions—has become a key area of interest in linguistics, lexicography, and natural language processing (NLP). These innovative phrasemes, which often arise in media discourse, social networks, and digital communication, combine lexical fixity with semantic dynamism, making them particularly challenging to identify, describe, and model.</p>
   <p> Following Lombard, Huyghe, and Gygax (2020), phraseological neologisms are defined as “new multiword expressions that result from the conventional use of a phrase and are characterized by non-compositionality.” For instance, the French expression être au taquet (lit. “to be at the cleat”) has been recently lexicalized with the meaning “to be going full throttle.”</p>
    <p>These expressions often exhibit a paradoxical combination of lexical fixity and semantic dynamism, making them difficult to detect, annotate, and model automatically.</p>
   <p> To better situate phraseological neologisms within broader processes of lexical innovation, it is first necessary to clarify what is meant by neologism in linguistic theory.</p>
   <p> The Oxford Dictionary of English defines a neologism as “a newly coined word or expression” (Soanes & Stevenson, 2005: 1179), while Webster’s Third New International Dictionary adopts a broader perspective, referring to “a new word, usage, or expression” (Gove et al., 1993: 1516), thereby explicitly integrating the notion of usage. Neologisms reflect ongoing social and cultural change and constitute a key indicator of linguistic vitality, as illustrated by recent lexical innovations such as teleworking, cryptocurrency, or generative artificial intelligence. As Crystal (1996: 73) notes, “the invention of new words is perhaps the most obvious way in which a language can exceed its existing resources.” Importantly, neology is not limited to the creation of new lexical items, but also encompasses innovative constructional patterns, morphological schemas, and shifts in grammatical categories.</p>
   <p> From a Natural Language Processing (NLP) perspective, the detection and analysis of neologisms—often approached through the identification of unknown or out-of-vocabulary words—has been the object of several research initiatives. In the French context, projects such as EDyLex (Sagot & Nouvel 2013a ; 2013b) and the Néoveille platform have proposed methods for the automatic detection, linguistic characterization, and monitoring of lexical innovation in large corpora, combining rule-based and statistical approaches. More recently, projects such as NeoLex have sought to extend these approaches by integrating lexicographic modeling and ontological structuring of neological data, with a particular emphasis on Chinese and Vietnamese, two languages that remain underrepresented in existing neology-oriented NLP projects (Chen, Dao et al. 2025 ; Chen & Nouvel & Dao et al. 2026). At the European level, recent initiatives such as the COST Action ENEOLI (2024–2027) aim to structure research on lexical innovation by fostering collaboration between linguistic, sociological, and computational approaches. Despite these efforts, NLP research on neology remains largely focused on single-word units, and the systematic modeling of more complex phenomena—such as phraseological neologisms—still appears to be underdeveloped. Recent work presented at the ACL Workshop on Multiword Expressions (MWE), including studies on neural identification, multilingual MWE detection, and large language model–based approaches, further highlights the growing interest in modeling MWEs in contemporary NLP (Baldwin et al. 2023; Barbu Mititelu et al. 2024; Hadj Mohamed et al. 2024; Kissane et al. 2024; De Leon 2025; Miletić et al. 2024; Savary et al. 2023).
</p>
    <p>While neology in single-word units has been extensively studied, neology in phraseology and multiword expressions (MWEs) remains comparatively underexplored. Research has long demonstrated that phraseological fixedness is not static: under the influence of social, economic, and political change, idioms and fixed expressions may undergo significant formal and semantic transformations. Studies on défigement (Mejri 2013, Chen 2022) and variation have shown that phraseological units are subject to creative manipulation, contextual adaptation, and semantic reanalysis.</p>
    <p>For each phraseological unit, it is therefore crucial to identify not only a canonical (lemmatized) form, but also its possible variants, including conjugational patterns, agreement constraints, alternative spellings, and syntactic realizations. Particular attention must be paid to discontinuous or disjunctive realizations, in which the components of a multiword unit are separated in the sentence while preserving their idiomatic meaning. As illustrated by Polguère (2020), expressions such as poser un lapin à quelqu’un (“to stand someone up”) may appear in syntactic variants like At the good friends’ meeting, there were often no rabbits, while avoir la pêche (“to feel energetic”) may occur in elliptical realizations such as What energy this morning!. Such cases demonstrate that collocations and fixed expressions can surface in dislocated or truncated forms, a phenomenon well documented in phraseological studies.</p>
    <p>Phraseological innovation offers a privileged perspective on language change, shedding light on the interaction between lexical dependencies, semantic restructuring, usage frequency, and socio-cultural factors. While multiword expressions (MWEs) are widely acknowledged as central units of linguistic description and processing—encompassing idiomatic expressions, collocations, fixed phrases, support verb constructions, and named entities—their neological dynamics remain comparatively underexplored, particularly from a computational perspective (Sag et al., 2002; Gross, 1982, 1996).</p>
   <p> The present volume, Multiword Expressions and Neology: Corpus Analysis and NLP Approaches, aims to address a significant gap in current research by focusing on the intersection of phraseology, neology, MWEs, corpus linguistics, lexical semantics, computational linguistics, lexicography and natural language processing (NLP). Some approaches have proven effective for identifying MWEs and capturing their internal variability, whether through statistical association measures, syntactic patterns, or machine-learning models (Smadja, 1993; Pecina, 2010; Ramisch et al., 2010a, 2010b; Vincze et al., 2011).</p>
   <p> Thus, we seeks to bring together contributions from computational linguistics, corpus linguistics, lexicography, psycholinguistics, and theoretical linguistics, with a strong emphasis on studies that combine theoretical insight with empirical and computational validation.  It focuses on how new multiword combinations are created, disseminated, conventionalized, and cognitively processed, as well as on how they can be automatically identified, modeled, and represented in NLP systems and lexicographic resources. Unlike traditional approaches that emphasize the stability and fixedness of MWEs, contemporary corpus data reveal a growing number of phraseological innovations arising from metaphorical extension, semantic shift, calquing, ellipsis, controlled variation, and contextual reuse. These phenomena challenge rigid classifications of MWEs and call for updated theoretical frameworks capable of accounting for both degrees of semantic opacity and patterns of syntactic flexibility (Gross, 1986; Mel’čuk, 2011). Cross-linguistic and multilingual research is particularly encouraged, especially work involving typologically distinct languages such as English and French (Indo-European), Chinese (Sino-Tibetan, largely analytic), and Vietnamese (Austroasiatic, analytic and tonal). Such perspectives are essential for understanding how cultural, cognitive, and structural factors shape the formation, diffusion, and conventionalization of neological MWEs, and for developing robust models capable of capturing phraseological innovation across languages.</p>

                           <h2>Reviewing Process</h2>

<p>
The volume will follow the publisher’s early two-reviewer (E2R) system. The reviewing process will proceed as follows:
</p>

<li>The first revision phase, including the selection of submitted chapters, will be supervised by the Volume Editors (VEs). Each chapter will be reviewed by two anonymous external reviewers (Reviewer 1s), recruited and coordinated by the VEs. The evaluations provided by these reviewers constitute the primary basis for revisions and are of central importance to the review process.</li>
<br/>

<li>A second reviewer appointed by the Series Editor (Reviewer 2) will have access to the full set of first-round reviews. Reviewer 2’s role is to ensure that the review process has been conducted with due diligence and to provide final approval before the Reviewer 1 reports, together with any additional recommendations, are transmitted to the authors via the Volume Editors.</li>

<br/>

<li>Upon acceptance by Reviewer 2, the Series Editor will inform the Volume Editors that the first-level reviews may be forwarded to the authors and that the volume is considered accepted under the E2R procedure. Authors will then incorporate the requested revisions.
</li>


<br/>


<li>The Volume Editors will compile the final version of the manuscript, integrating all revisions and any additional recommendations. Acceptance for proof-reading by the publisher will be based on the final submitted volume.
</li>
